## ‚ùó Important Notice

**This GUI is no longer supported and is now deprecated.**  
As of mid-2025, the game **Wizard Life (WL)** is broken due to Roblox‚Äôs mandatory chat system update, which removed support for legacy chat. Since **Wizard Life is no longer being updated**, this GUI no longer functions as intended.

> üõë **This GUI was made *only* for Wizard Life.**  
> üö´ **It will not work in any other game.**  
> üîê **Even if you try, you can‚Äôt use it without a valid access key.**

This repository is now archived for reference only. No further updates or support will be provided.
